# A Primer on Next Generation Matrix Models

A Next Generation Matrix (here after referred to as NGM) is a way to represent the expected number of infections generated by a single infected individual in different groups or categories of the population across generations. This is related to the branching process concept of an offspring distribution generated by each individual. The matrix represents the
