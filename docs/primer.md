# A Primer on Next Generation Matrix Models

A Next Generation Matrix model is a way to model the expected number of infections generated by a single infected individual in different groups or categories of the population per unit time. The Next Generation Matrix (here after referred to as NGM) encodes this information. NGM models are an effective way to model average dynamics during the early growth phase of an epidemic in the limit of the disease-free equilibrium.

The NGM is akin to the branching process concept of an offspring distribution generated by each individual. In this context, the NGM represents the expected value of the offspring distribution or distribution of infections caused in a group from an individual in another group.
